# Contributing

The goals of this project are to 
(1) translate Grothendieck's essay from French to various other languages,
and (2) typeset those translations nicely online.
Regarding contributing to the second goal, it's the wild west:
Feel free to open an issue or start a discussion,
or just fork then edit then make a merge request and hope I like it ðŸ˜‰
Regarding the first goal though, 
there are some guidelines to adhere to to keep organized.


## Guidelines on Translating

To keep an organized translation workflow,
here are a few things I'd prefer contributors keep in mind:

  - If you'd like to talk about the accuracy of an existing translation,
    bring it up on the [discussions page](https://github.com/mikepierce/grothendieck-kimchi/discussions).

  - If you'd like to create a new translations
  
  The original French can be found [scanned here]()
