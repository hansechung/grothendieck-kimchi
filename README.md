# Grothendieck's Musings on Kimchi

This is a working English translation of Alexander Grothendieck's essay on kimchi.
I have little to do with the words; 
I'm simply organizing/crowdsourcing the translation via GitHub. 
Please feel free to 
[contribute](https://github.com/mikepierce/grothendieck-kimchi/issues) anything you can!
A scan of the original French can be found 
[here](http://www.ihes.fr/~damour/IMAGE/kimchi_grothendieck.pdf). 
If you don't know what kimchi is, then I encourage you to 
[watch this](https://youtu.be/W4hvneKcPZI).
A live, and nicely typeset, version of this translation can be found at 
[mikepierce.github.io/grothendieck-kimchi](https://mikepierce.github.io/grothendieck-kimchi).
