&ldquo;Sweet Kimchi&rdquo;.
This is a misnomer,
for a preparation of fruits and vegetables of Japanese origin, not Korean.
The traditional preparation was given to me by a Buddhist monk friend&mdash;&#8203;
it is a mixture of approximately equal parts apples,
carrots, onions, cut into slices to which one adds a good quantity of white sugar
(on the order of a quarter or a fifth of the total volume),
all in an earthenware pot. Within several hours,
the sugar extracting the juice of the fruit and vegetables,
the preparation begins to bathe in its own juice.
A little like salt in Kimchi,
the essential role of sugar is to guarantee good preservation of the mix,
and in this case to prevent alcoholic fermentation.
The preparation obtained can be kept long enough,
and is used as tonic&mdash;especially the liquid.

Before learning this recipe, 
I was making similar preparations
with only apples or all other types of fruit,
with sugar&mdash;it&rsquo;s especially useful for preserving fruit
which are likely to spoil.
For apples, pears, plums, quince etc,
one cuts them into slices to allow the sugar to penetrate and extract the juice;
for cherries one crushes them a bit in the sugar to start
the process of juice formation.
The idea is to make a sort of jam, without cooking.
One of the advantages over traditional jam is that one uses significantly less sugar,
moreover the white sugar is transformed under the action
of enzymes in the fruit into less aggressive and more assimilable sugars,
with a sweeter taste (glucose, fructose etc)&mdash;&#8203;
on the whole the original scent of the fruit is preserved nearly intact.
On the other hand the preservation is shorter than for jams,
mainly due to the fact that the upper part of the pot leaves the fruit
(which float in the liquid) in contact with the air.
Without putting in more sugar,
it ends with alcoholic fermentation,
generally after several weeks.
One might either let this continue,
and harvest a fruit liqueur;
or decant the liquid in bottles
(and drink it as a more or less full-bodied ap√©ritif depending on the degree of fermentation),
and cook the fruit over very low heat (without necessarily bringing it to a boil),
so as to evaporate the alcoholic vapors.
One may thus preserve the fruit so treated as jam,
it has a more delicate flavor because the scent of the fruit remained intact.

&ldquo;Sweet Kimchi&rdquo; can be eaten as a dessert,
adding a few drops of lemon juice if necessary to increase the acidity level.
It can also be used for delicious drinks,
or to prepare infusions by adding boiling water to it in a bowl.
</p>
<p>
After learning about
the Japanese preparation apples-carrots-onions,
I made a good number of &ldquo;sweet Kimchi&rdquo; with mixtures of fruit
and all sorts of vegetables&mdash;including carrots, turnips, red cabbage,
celery root, kohlrabi<label for="sn-kohlrabi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-kohlrabi" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote">A &ldquo;German turnip&rdquo;</span> &hellip;
The onion is in any case a particularly fortuitous ingredient,
giving the preparation a cachet not replicable with any other vegetable.
One can add any aromatic of one&rsquo;s choice,
notably ginger, or finely cut lemon peel.
I also sometimes added crushed peanuts.
I have had no disappointments
with any &ldquo;sweet Kimchi&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ve made so far,
I found them all very good,
up to the last at the bottom of the pots or bottles,
and it was the same with occasional visitors who tasted them.
The common quality to these preparations and of Kimchi itself,
is it allows an unlimited range for the initiative
and the imagination of those who do them,
with considerable flexibility of use,
which always lets one make the most of the particular resources available at the moment.
