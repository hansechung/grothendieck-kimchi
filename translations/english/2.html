All vegetables are suitable for Kimchi,
except starchy vegetables (potatoes, peas, beans).
The vegetables most used in Korea are cabbages of all kinds,
turnips, Chinese radishes, and cucumbers.
With turnips and radishes, the leaves are also used&mdash;&#8203;
in general, the tops of almost all root vegetables
(except potatoes and tomatoes) are good for consumption,  
and are in fact delicious.
Thus onion and turnip greens,
in addition to the bulbs of these vegetables,
are a common ingredient for flavoring a &ldquo;water&rdquo; Kimchi.
Traditionally Koreans do not use carrots
or red beets to make their Kimchi,
however I have made delicious Kimchis with both
(For carrots, I was encouraged to do so,
having learned that pickled carrots are common in Egypt.) 
Also Koreans use only one vegetable per jar of Kimchi
(in addition to those added as herbs),
however I have made some excellent mixes,
notably turnips and carrots
(this mixture also being Egyptian inspired).
I made some Kimchi mixtures of turnips and red beets, 
but did not continue,
because the very fine taste of the turnip was a bit drowned by the 
by the intense taste of the beet.
It is good to handle combinations of flavor with care &hellip;

The essential ingredients of Kimchi are vegetables,
salt, herbs, and (for water Kimchi), water.
In addition to the necessary care,
the quality of Kimchi depends on the quality of the ingredients&mdash;&#8203;
ensuring this quality is part of the care to be taken in the preparation of Kimchi.
The role of salt and herbs, in addition to taste and dietary functions,
is to act as moderator, to regulate the fermentation of the vegetable.
Where possible one should avoid commercial white salt,
and obtain raw salt (grey colored, if sea salt).
Vegetables of the highest possible quality are used,
given the source and freshness,
removing any parts which are faded or doubtful
(leaving them for soups or other culinary preparations for immediate consumption).
There is no reluctance on the other hand to use the core of the cabbage, 
or the tail of the turnip, when these are healthy (as they should be for a healthy vegetable).  
For water, spring water (which is still abundant in Korea) is of course the best.

The traditional Korean spices for the preparation of Kimchi are garlic,
fresh ginger and red pepper. 
The first two are must-haves in all Korean Kimchi,
and it is rare for pepper to be absent in such a Kimchi. 
(Also Korean Kimchi is most often red or pink in color,
and where pepper is absent it is called &ldquo;white Kimchi&rdquo;.)
Korean red pepper is weaker than the pepper used in Europe,
from Africa.
The latter can irritate the intestinal mucosa, 
especially if it is absorbed regularly,  
which is why I have more or less given up on including it in the preparation of Kimchi.
On the other hand, it is not always easy to get fresh ginger in Europe,  
 and often it is quite expensive, especially outside big cities like Paris.
Garlic remains the base flavor.  
One can additionally add,
depending on taste and inspiration, any other locally available herb.  
Notably, I've used rosemary
(in the Egyptian torchi<label for="sn-torchi" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label> <input type="checkbox" id="sn-torchi" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="sidenote"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torshi">Torshi</a> is a dish of pickled vegetables common in Balkan and Middle Eastern countries.</span> fennel, juniper berries (as for sauerkraut).
In addition, in water Kimchis, one usually infuses onion,  
and onion or leek greens,  
cut into cylinders about 10 cm in length,
of turnips and carrots),
split longitudinally with a knife so the flavor
of the herb better penetrates the surrounding water.
Also, you can add some fresh or dried whole peppers to the jar,
which contribute to the preservation of the Kimchi
and give it a slightly spicier flavor,
without risking an irritating effect like chili powder. 
As for garlic (and always for water Kimchi),
each peeled clove is cut in half (or three, if it is large),  
and left to infuse in the jar, with the other spices.
Spices are only crushed by mortar for waterless Kimchi.

<p>
The amount of salt and spices to add to a jar of Kimchi is adjusted to taste,
which must be engaging, neither too strong nor too weak.
It&rsquo;s best to put too little at the start than too much,
even adding more the next day,
which presents no difficulty.
A strongly salted and spiced Kimchi can be delicious, 
provided it is served as condiment
(notably to accompany potatoes or grains),
rather than as a dish of vegetables.
