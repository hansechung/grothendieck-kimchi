The materials necessary for the preparation of Kimchi
(apart from the ingredients just mentioned)
are very simple.
The most important is the earthenware or stoneware pot.
It is good to have an assortment of different sizes,
depending on quantities of available vegetables in different cases.  
In Korea family pots of 100 or 200 liters are common practice 
and they are inexpensive&mdash;&#8203;
for our use pots between 3 and 20 liters will undoubtedly work,
we can find some commercially without much trouble
(even placing an order if necessary),
for prices varying according to size,
from thirty to 200 francs.
Lids should also be available for the pots,  
which should never be left open when in use.
Plates generally work, 
and are preferable to wooden boards,   
which promote the appearance of mold.
It is good when preparing the Kimchi to choose a pot of appropriate size,
so that it is almost full and not only half full, 
to avoid much contact with air.

To draw Kimchi from the pot, 
use a wooden spatula or spoon for waterless Kimchi,
a ladle (preferably wooden) for water Kimchi.  
The spoon and ladle must be clean and dry (wipe them after washing!),
to avoid introducing parasitic fermentations into the pot and causing the Kimchi to &ldquo;turn.&rdquo;
Do not use the same spoon or ladle for two or more pots of Kimchi,
without having washed and dried it after each use.
Avoid taking Kimchi with your hand in the pot,
unless it has just been washed.
When you have taken Kimchi in a bowl and it remains after the meal,
do not put it back in the pot,
but keep it to finish it at a following meal.
It will keep for several days in a bowl without problem,  
while the Kimchi in the pot should keep for several weeks,
even several months.

As material for the actual preparation,  
a board for cutting vegetables must be provided,
a large kitchen knife,
several buckets or large bowls for washing and kneading vegetables,
one or two large round sieves made of woven straw or bamboo for drainage&mdash;&#8203;
you can find Chinese imports for twenty to thirty francs.
I have two of them and even outside of the preparation of Kimchi,
they are used almost every day,
to wash vegetables or cereals,
as fruit and vegetable baskets etc.  
Finally, for waterless Kimchis,
you need a mortar with pestle to crush the salt and the spices together.
