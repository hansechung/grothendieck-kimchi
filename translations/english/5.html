It remains for me to give instructions for the actual preparation,
distinguishing the two cases, with or without water.  
In both cases, the vegetables must first be washed very carefully. With plenty of water,
brush the root vegetables
and cut and detach the leaves from the leafy vegetables,
in a way that ensures a thorough cleaning.
At the same time, all wilted, wormy, or otherwise questionable parts of the vegetable are to be removed.
There is no question of peeling the root vegetables,
the skin of which is an inseparable ingredient.
Then cut the vegetables.
The fineness of the cutting is not dictated;
the Korean custom is to cut the leaves significantly less than in sauerkraut,
and to cut the roots into small sticks,
two or three times larger than fries.
The coarser the cutting, the slower the fermentation.  
For cucumbers, the fermentation of which is generally very rapid,
we sometimes limit ourselves to cutting each cucumber into four quarters.   
For green tomatoes,
generally intended to be kept for several months,
even all winter, they are sometimes left whole.
(Red tomatoes are not suitable for the preparation of Kimchi,
as fermentation tends to reduce them to mush.)
Of course,
the shape of the cut is a matter of tradition, and the bacteria, I think, don't care&mdash;&#8203;
thus in Egypt, carrots are cut into rings, not into sticks.
</p>
<p>
The simplest preparation is Kimchi with water.
We put the cut vegetables in a jar so that it is more or less full,
cover them with cool water, add salt (to taste),
and then the aromatics, as explained in part 2.
If you have ginger, just cut it into thin strips,
without crushing them with a mortar.
We cover the jar, put it in a suitable quiet place, and we&rsquo;re done.
</p>
<p>
For Kimchi without water, you must first crush the aromatics in a mortar.  
I crush them together with salt,
which facilitates the formation of the aromatic paste through simultaneous grinding.
When it comes to vegetables without leaves, i.e. only roots,  
one mixes the cut vegetables with the ground herbs and salt in a bowl,
doing it several times over if necessary,
carefully piling up and tamping the mixed vegetables in the pot.
One then rinses the mortar and the bowl with about half a glass of water,
as well as one&rsquo;s hands, so as to recover all the spices;
the water collected at the bottom of the bowl is then poured over the vegetables in the pot
and is used to initiate fermentation.
If the vegetables are dry enough,
we will then be more generous with the amount of water with aromatics added to begin.
</p>
<p>
The process is the same for Kimchi without water made with leafy vegetables,
except that there is an additional step in the preparation, which is very important.
This step is essential in particular to ensure normal fermentation.
We pile up the leaves which we have washed and possibly
cut (in the case of large-sized leaves)
in one or more bowls or pails,
sprinkling them with salt as we go and tamping the leaves well,
especially if they are rather rough. 
It may also be good to sprinkle them with a little water (in a bowl next to you)
as you pile up the leaves in the container.
Then cover with the inverted sieve,  
or with a cloth, and let it sit for a few hours,
or one night at most.
The purpose of this operation is to let the salt begin to enter
the leaf to wilt it. (It can be useful,
after a few hours, to turn the vegetables over,
so that the salt water accumulated at the bottom passes over the vegetables again,
if they aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;drooping&rdquo; enough yet.)
By this method, the vegetables are compacted and
will go in the jar more easily,
and start to make juice as soon as you squeeze them by pushing down on them.
However, the leaves should not be left to macerate for so long in the bowl,
that they already begin to produce their own juice,
which would then be lost. 
</p>
<p>
When the leaves have macerated enough,
wash them in plenty of water,
and drain them through a sieve or sieves.
The salt used in the preliminary maceration is thus lost&mdash;&#8203;
you should not think about using the salt water at the bottom of the bowl
for the Kimchi we&rsquo;re going to prepare!
Once the leaves are drained,
we mix them with the spices and put them in jars as before.
</p>
<p>
It is even more important here to pack the leaves well in the jar,
as we pile them up,
by pressing them down with our fists and all our weight, or with a wooden ladle.
There must indeed be no air trapped in the mass of Kimchi
(this also applies to root vegetables), and moreover,
the vegetable juice must come out enough
to cover the entire surface of the vegetable.
It is common in Korea, for some vegetables composed of roots and leaves,
such as radishes, not to separate the roots from the leaves,
therefore macerating the roots at the same time as the attached tops.
This makes a particularly appetizing Kimchi,
for both the eye and for the mouth.
The difficulty, however, comes in piling these vegetables in the jar,
both without crushing them and without leaving an air pocket anywhere.
This is how I had misfortune with
a jar of Chinese radish Kimchi that started to turn.
I managed to fix it by separating the leaves and roots, recutting the roots etc. &hellip;
this is one of the two cases discussed above. Subsequently,
I have preferred to prepare the roots and the tops separately.
</p>
<p>
For cucumbers, which are vegetables that are easily crushed,
mixing them with the spices must be done with delicacy,
as well as putting them in the jar, under risk of reducing them to a pulp.
Cucumber Kimchi tends to ferment quickly
and it&rsquo;s not a question of making a Kimchi out of them with a long shelf life,
except for leaving them whole, or possibly accompanied by green tomatoes.
When it comes to using cucumbers cut into sticks,
it will hardly keep more than one or two weeks,
and the question of air pockets arises very little,
especially since it settles by itself without having to press with any effort.
Cucumber Kimchi is particularly delicious.
Towards the end it tends to go a little mushy,
which gives it a less appetizing appearance,
while its taste is still delicious.
The best thing is to use it in soups,
which get a very refreshing and delicate taste, thanks to the fermented cucumbers.
