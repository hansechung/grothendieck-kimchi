The preparation and conservation of kimchi is one of the simplest things and
there is no problem once you dedicate a minimum amount of intelligence and care to it.
(Anyone who is not disposed to put in this minimum amount of investment
would do better to feed themselves with preserved foods.) The first and foremost demand is cleanliness.
All instruments used for the preparation and handling of Kimchi must be clean.
More precisely, when you are preparing Kimchi,
the pot that you are about to use must be washed carefully, both inside and outside,
and dried on the inside with a clean towel.
Likewise for the seals and bowls, the cutting board etc.
The work surface must be free of all other objects when you are preparing Kimchi, and clean.
Your hands and arms are clean,
and especially when mixing the vegetables with the seasonings
(in the case of Kimchi without water).
You will avoid filling the pot to the brim,
so that the plate-lid is not in contact with the Kimchi,
and also to prevent the pot from overflowing after the &ldquo;action&rdquo; of the Kimchi in the first days.
</p>
<p>
In the days following the preparation of the Kimchi,
while the fermentation is beginning, it is worth checking how it is proceeding,
by stirring Kimchi with water to cause the vegetables that have floated to the surface to sink again
and to prevent them from drying out or rotting,
or by tamping (with a wooden spoon or a ladle, or with washed hands)
Kimchi without water, so that the juice runs over the Kimchi,
the top of which should stay wet.
You should do this every one or two days.
Once the Kimchi is ready to be eaten,
it is enough to use the Kimchi regularly in order to guarantee
that the slowed fermentation process will continue properly,
without the appearance of any parasitic fermentation, and especially of any moulds.
The sign of a successful fermentation is a fresh, appetising smell, never a foul smell.
When you have not taken any Kimchi out of a pot for a while,
it is good to spend a few minutes
stirring Kimchi with water, tamping Kimchi without water,
and, if necessary, turning over the Kimchi on the surface of the pot
to moisten the part that would have tended to dry out.
The appearance of a veil of mould is not a catastrophe,
it is absorbed without difficulty in the mass of Kimchi when it is caught in time,
and does not alter its flavour.
On the other hand, a Kimchi which is neglected for more than a week,
or for several weeks, is at serious risk of spoiling.
And as a consequence, it is good to make arrangements
when you must be absent for a duration of more than a week.
</p>
<p>
You must allow, according to the season and the temperature,
for several days (perhaps up to ten or so)
from the day of preparation before the Kimchi is ready
(incidentally, it is pleasant to eat right from the beginning,
but less good than after the fermentation has continued for a while).
When it is ready, it is preferable to store the Kimchi in a cool location,
to avoid too fast a fermentation.
Refrigerators are not to be used. On the other hand, in the middle of summer,
lacking a cool cellar, you can put the pot in a bowl with some water,
place a towel on top, and leave the ends of the towel soaking in the bowl,
which suffices to prevent the Kimchi from &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; in the pot.
In summer in Korea, people too poor to have a cellar bury their pots in the ground,
leaving only the neck sticking out,
which suffices to keep them at the necessary temperature.
</p>
<p>
When the amount of Kimchi in the pot gets low,
make sure that there is no Kimchi stuck to the sides of the pot above the level of the mass of Kimchi,
by bringing it back towards the main mass with a wooden spoon or a ladle.
</p>
<p>
As the fermentation progresses,
over the span of weeks or months,
the flavour of the Kimchi becomes stronger
naturally, without actually turning foul.
Some prefer Kimchi to be more fermented, some prefer it less fermented.
For those who don't like Kimchi in a very acidic state,
I highlight that they may &ldquo;extend&rdquo; it
by using it particularly in soups.
Kimchi soups are very pleasant soups,
you can put in (as well as Kimchi) absolutely anything you like:
fresh or dried vegetables, various grains, meat, fish&mdash;&#8203;
the result is always a nice surprise.
You can make substantial soups that remain fresh for several days without a problem.
It is also popular in Korea to take highly fermented Kimchi and re-fry it,
but keep in mind that this will have a tendency to further concentrate the flavours,
unless you mix the Kimchi with other ingredients.
</p>
<p>
In principle, a Kimchi carefully prepared and carefully handled will not go bad.
The Korean friend who taught me the art of Kimchi
confirms that she has never seen a Kimchi spoil in Korea,
or heard of any such thing happening, and I believe her freely,
since Kimchi is a foundational element of a thousand-year-old culture there.
I have been practising Kimchi for six years,
and on two occasions (in the beginning stages) I have had a Kimchi go bad:
once I had to throw it away after several days,
whereas the other time, the situation could be salvaged.
There have also been one or two times when I have had to throw away the ends of pots
that I had forgotten a little.
If a Kimchi has suffered any misfortune (which happens sometimes here!),
it is often possible to salvage the situation&mdash;&#8203;
one way is to add some salt, some seasonings, or both;
another, to put it in the cold.
