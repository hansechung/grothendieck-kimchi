Kimchi is a preparation of fermented vegetables,
by a &ldquo;lactic&rdquo; fer&shy;mentation like sauer&shy;kraut,
in the traditional Korean way.
Kimchi is, along with rice,
the staple of Korean cooking, 
where a meal (even a light one) is unthinkable without one or the other.
This is equally true during the six months
of the year in Korea where fresh vegetables are available,
and accompany the meals together with Kimchi.

Since I learned how to prepare Kimchi,
it has become a daily ingredient in my food
and it is rare that I do not have one or more jars of Kimchi at my disposal.
The advantages of Kimchi are numerous and obvious.
Carefully prepared, it has an exquisite taste, 
refreshing in summer, stimulating in any season.
Fermentation adds new qualities to vegetables,
adding again to those of the fresh vegetables,
aiding digestion and making an irreplaceable intestinal regulator;
there is no contraindication even for sick people, on the contrary,
apart from the fact that in some cases one will refrain from strongly spiced kimchi.
With a (necessary) minimum of care,
the preparation of Kimchi is one of the simplest,
and in a few of the most pleasant hours of prep work
one has at one&rsquo;s disposition vegetables that are ready  
to be eaten&mdash;without any further preparation (cooking or otherwise)&mdash;for weeks
or even months.
(In Korea, the family Kimchi for winter is prepared around September,
and constitutes the supply of consumable vegetables
for the six months of the very harsh Korean winter.)
It&rsquo;s inexpensive food,
because one can arrange to make a preparation with such vegetables,
at the time when we have them in abundance.
