As is no doubt clear from all the above,
Kimchi is intended in principle to be eaten as is,
without cooking beforehand, to accompany rice or other grains,
or starches like beans or potatoes.
The liquid from water Kimchi is particularly delicious,
and may be drunk separately from a bowl or glass; 
one takes care however to always leave enough
juice in the pot so that the vegetables remain entirely covered.
Koreans eat Kimchi in a bowl,
while rice (well softened) is served on plates and eaten with a spoon.
There is nothing wrong of course with mixing different Kimchis on
one&rsquo;s plate or bowl,
on the other hand there is no question of mixing one pot of Kimchi with another
(for example two pots which are nearly finished)
any more than one may use an old Kimchi
to &ldquo;start&rdquo; the fermentation of a new one.
Fermentation starts itself by the action of bacteria in the air.

For a Kimchi of green tomatoes or whole cucumbers,
the most pleasant presentation for the meal is to cut
the vegetable in thin slices, which better brings out the delicacy of the flavor.
When it comes to infusions of short duration,
one serves the vegetable in the liquid in which it was steeped.
For longer infusions,
one must make saltier brines,
unfit for consumption,
especially as after a few months they take on
a slightly brackish taste.
Koreans are thus used to serving
green tomatoes or cucumbers in a salad bowl,
cut into thin slices, with fresh spring water added upon serving.
The flavor of the vegetable immediately diffuses in the water and gives it a delicious taste,
at the same time the flavor of the vegetable itself becomes less concentrated. Served differently, it instead takes the form of a condiment,
like pickles.
